## Part 2
Case study: Find a software/lib that uses the testing tool


* **Q2.1. What is the purpose of the sw/lib, i.e. what does it aim to do for users/developers?**
Watir is a Ruby open source library designed to automate testing. This is powered by Selenium, engaging in the same way people 
do with browsers: starting the tab, searching through various sites, clicking on links, filling out forms, etc.

* **Q2.2. What are the key technologies used to develop the lib?**
   It blends the fundamentals of ruby programming experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build server running web applications.
     
 * **Q2.3. What kind of automated testing tools are used to test the sw/lib (including but possible more than YTT) 
 and what are their key features?** 
 As you can see [here](https:/www.outsource2india.com / software / articles / top-10-automation-testing-tools.asp), there are several 
 various automated testing tools for different uses. For performance testing, API testing, application testing, mobile testing and 
 functional testing, they use different automated testing methods. Junit is important for the production of the test driven and it
 is useful for the test frameworks. Studio Catalan supports integration. The product of building kataloan studio in report is very easy
 to explore in PDF, HTML, Excel or CSV formats. Appium tools permit the tester to use real equipment, emulators, and simulators.
 
 * **Q2.4. Which features of the automated testing tools are currently used by the test suite?**
 There are several common resources for testing as I described earlier, one of the other reference is Selenium which is the common 
 resources for web application testing. Selenium provides a method of replay for writing specific tests without learning the language 
 of scripting.
 
 * **Q2.5. Which features of the automated testing tools are NOT used by the test suite?** Actually, I am not sure. I didn't find any features 
 that is not used by the test suit.
 
 ## Part 3 Interview developers/testers of YTT
 
 * **Q3.1. Reach out to the developers of YTT and ask them about their reasons for developing YTT. Why this particular type of testing 
 technology? Which situations isit good for and less good for?** 
 Waiting for an answer. I sent an comment through this link https://developers.facebook.com/support/
 
 * **Q3.2 Ask them how mature they think YTT is? Is it suitable for use by companiesdeveloping real-world software at scale?
 Why / why not?** Waiting for an answer. I sent an comment through this link https://developers.facebook.com/support/
 
 * **Q3.3. Ask them how they plan to evolve and develop YTT going forward. What are the main improvements needed to take the tool
 to the next level?** Waiting for an answer. I sent an comment through this link https://developers.facebook.com/support/
